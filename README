FramerD is a high-performance distributed object database optimized
for storing and operating over large pointer-intensive data
structures, especially those used to represent the semantic knowledge
used in intelligent document analysis and search.

Conventional databases based on relational algebra (any SQL-oriented
product) are not optimized for pointer-intensive data, but many
knowledge-based algorithms make heavy use of pointer-following and
expansion over such data.  FramerD uses an alternate model supporting
billions of *unique objects* with lightweight pointers and a range of
caching strategies for resolving object pointers to complex structured
objects.  This model is incorporated with the ability to manage very
large dynamically modifiable *indices* that map arbitrary structured
objects to collections of object references.

The underlying content model is a dynamically typed data model based
on associational structures for mapping property identifiers (which
may themselves be object pointers) to values.  These associational
structures are called "frames" after the term classically used for
such entities in artificial intelligence.
