Description: Scalable knowledge base development and application platform
 FramerD provides a robust and scalable object database especially
 designed and optimized for pointer-intensive semi-structured data with
 complex or evolving data models.  FramerD includes full support for
 Unicode in both data and programs together with powerful tools for
 text processing and linguistic analysis.
 FramerD natively supports reading and and generation of XML, HTML, and
 MIME data.  Web services support has long included built-in support
 for processing CGI requests both directly and with fastcgi.  With
 version 2.4, FramerD comes with mod_fdserv, a lightweight extension to
 the Apache webserver for transparently managing persistent
 multi-threaded servlets responding to CGI requests.
