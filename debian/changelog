framerd (2.6.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version with many improvements, including:
    * Numerous bug fixes and expanded error handling
    * Added new kind of file index which scales better to multi-million
      key file indices and is based on multiplicative hashing
    * General improvements to FDSCRIPT module system
    * Defined more core primitive inference procedures especially around
      structured (assoc/pair) slots
    * Added generic facility for file/module reloading
    * Various frame operation  optimizations
    * Added new primitives for accessing serial ports (including USB serial ports)
    * Numerous fixes and additions to arithmetic functions in FDScript
    * Improvements to index caching performance
    * Added compound indices which combine multiple indices with a shared cache.
    * Added subservers on index servers, allowing a server to provide
      several distinct index tables
    * Provided C API access to ints and strings in config files
    * New, simpler command line parsing API
    * Use long longs as OIDs if possible
    * Added support for largefiles (> 2GB) for pools and indices
    * Added synchronization for pools and indices
    * Use file memory mapping for file pools and indices for dramatically
      improved performance in many cases;
    * Further optimiziations to choice/set handling
    * Added "schema slotmaps" to reduce memory footprint for homogenous databases
    * Extensions to support extensive malloc debugging
    * Introduced interned ZSTRINGS as a core data type
    * Extended the frame data model by adding *adjuncts* which allow
      index mappings to specify particular slots of for particular pools.
    * Separated out get-methods and compute-methods
    * Different pools and indices on the same server now get their own
      network connection
    * Added finer grained locks for pool and index access to improve SMP
      performance.
    * Optimized index retrieval to return sorted choices
    * Added tools to manage malformed UTF-8 text (important for DMOZ integration)
    * Improved ability to preload indices to improve performance
    * Fixes to HTML/XML integration with special attention to XML
    * Fix mime parsing with BASE64 encoding
    * Added tools for parsing structured (tab, space, etc) plaintext
    * Separated out the FDTEXT and FDWWW libraries
    * Made FDXML actually be usable and added callout models to have FDXML
      call Scheme to generate content.
