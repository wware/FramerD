* Installing the distribution under WIN32

Go into the FramerD root directory (probably where you found this file) and type:
  etc\install.bat "\Program Files\FramerD\"
and then add "\Program Files\FramerD\exe\" to your path or run the programs
out of there directly.  The script etc/setup.fdx stores the installation path
in the registry, which means you can use a different target directory but that
a given user can only have installation.

* Installing a freshly built distribution under Unix

Just type:
  make install
or
  gmake install

Depending on the --prefix provided during configuration (/usr/local is
the default), executables are put in $prefix/bin, libraries in
$prefix/lib, and include files in $prefix/include.  The directory
$prefix/share/framerd is setup to store the installation's
configuration file and default super pool.  It will have the
subdirectory $prefix/share/framerd/modules which will start out
sparsely populated.

* Installing a binary distribution under Unix
